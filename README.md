Speech Recognition and Translation

This Python script uses the SpeechRecognition library to recognize speech input from a microphone and translates it from Hindi to English using the mtranslate library. The translated text is then printed in the console.

Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Install required packages using: `pip install speech_recognition mtranslate colorama`

Usage:
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. The program will continuously listen for speech input and print translated text in the console.

File Descriptions:
- `speech_translate.py`: The main Python script containing the speech recognition and translation logic.
- `mtranslate`: A third-party library used for translation.
- `colorama`: A third-party library used for colored console output.

Code Structure:
- `print_loop()`: Function to continuously print "Listening...." in green.
- `translation_hin_to_eng(text)`: Function to translate Hindi text to English.
- `listen()`: Function to continuously listen for speech, recognize, and print translated text.
- The script uses threading to run the listening and printing functions concurrently.

Customization:
- Adjust the speech recognition parameters in the `listen` function if needed.
- Customize the translation logic or use a different translation library.
